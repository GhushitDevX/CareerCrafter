        <h1>What is AI engineering?</h1>
        <p>Artificial intelligence engineers are individuals who use AI and machine learning techniques to develop applications and systems that can help organizations increase efficiency, cut costs, increase profits, and make better business decisions.<br>
        AI engineering focuses on developing the tools, systems, and processes that enable artificial intelligence to be applied in the real world. Any application where machines mimic human functions, such as solving problems and learning, can be considered artificial intelligence. Algorithms are “trained” by data, which helps them to learn and perform better.</p>

        <h1>AI engineer responsibilities</h1>
        <p>AI engineers play an important role in organizations that use AI. They chart the AI strategy and define the problems to be solved with AI. They’re in charge of building AI development and production infrastructure and then implementing them. Here are some specific tasks and responsibilities of an AI engineer:</p>
        <div class="role">
        <ul>
            <li>Create and manage the AI development and production infrastructure.</li><br>
            <li>Conduct statistical analysis and interpret the results to guide and optimize the organization’s decision-making process.</li><br>
            <li>Automate AI infrastructures for the data science team.</li><br>
            <li>Build AI models from scratch and help product managers and other stakeholders with analysis and implementation.</li><br>
            <li>Transform machine learning models into APIs that can be integrated with other applications.</li><br>
            <li>Collaborate across teams to help with AI adoption and best practices. </li><br>
        </ul>
