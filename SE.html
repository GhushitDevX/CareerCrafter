        <h1>What do software engineers do?</h>
        </div>
        <div class="p">
            <p>Successful engineers know how to use the right programming languages, platforms, and architectures to develop everything from computer games to network control systems. In addition to building their own systems, software engineers also test, improve, and maintain software built by other engineers.<br><br>

                "I get excited about anything that involves solving problems, whether it be figuring out how to optimize a certain part of an existing application or entirely coming up with new applications to solve certain needs," says Murtadha Al-Tameemi, a software engineer at Meta. "Problems in general stimulate my brain and give me a great sense of satisfaction."<br><br>
                
                In this role, your day-to-day tasks might include:</p>
                <div class="list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designing and maintaining software systems</li>
                        <li>Evaluating and testing new software programs</li>
                        <li>Optimizing software for speed and scalability</li>
                        <li>Writing and testing code</li>
                        <li>Consulting with clients, engineers, security specialists, and other stakeholders</li>
                        <li>Presenting new features to stakeholders and internal customers</li>

        <h1>Systems developer vs. application developer</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="p">
        <p>Software engineers will usually fall into one of two categories, systems engineers or application developers.<br><br>

            As a systems engineer, you’ll build things like computer systems and networks that applications need to function. You can do this by:</p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring that different types of software programs communicate with each other on one platform</li>
                <li>Creating and enforcing IT standards within an infrastructure</li>
                <li>Maintaining documentation of IT systems </li>
                <li>Updating to new technologies as needed</li>
                <li>Collaborating with development teams, senior systems architects, and data science professionals </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Working as an application developer is more client-focused. You may work on either the front or back end of the system, designing software that the end user will interact with. Tasks might include:</p>   
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>Developing applications for iOS, Android, Windows, or other operating systems</li>
                <li>Conducting an analysis of requirements and tweaking software as needed</li>
                <li>Releasing software updates</li>
                <li>Working with graphic designers, customer service staff, project managers, and other customer-facing departments </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h1>Is software engineering a good career?</h1>
        </div>
    <div class="p">
            <p>If you enjoy solving problems and have strong analytical skills, a career as a software engineer can be both fun and challenging. As technology continues to evolve, the need for software developers continues to grow much faster than the national average.<br><br> 

                Choosing a career as a software engineer gives you opportunities to work in many different industries and fields, as nearly all businesses use software. Whether you enjoy finances, entertainment, sports, real estate, or some other industry, there’s a good chance there are jobs for software engineers.<br><br>
                
                It’s also a career that allows flexibility in where you work. You may be able to work from home for companies in other states or even other countries. The important thing is that you’re able to meet deadlines and deliver a project on time.</p>

        <h1>How to become a software engineer</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="p">
        <p>Getting a job as a software engineer typically involves building the right technical and workplace skills. Some jobs might also require a certain degree or certification to validate your skills. However, there are many ways to enhance your skill set.<br><br>

            "Although I did have a formal education, taking online classes on how to build mobile apps, doing internships where I work on projects at a company, and trying to build my own side projects was the most helpful," says Laila Rizvi, a software engineer at Meta.<br><br>
            
            Let’s take a closer look at some of the requirements for becoming a software engineer.</p>
