        <h1>What does a data scientist do?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="p">
        <p>Data scientists determine the questions their team should be asking and figure out how to answer those questions using data. They often develop predictive models for theorizing and forecasting.<br><br>
            A data scientist might do the following tasks on a day-to-day basis:</p>
            <div class="list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Find patterns and trends in datasets to uncover insights</li>
                    <li>Create algorithms and data models to forecast outcomes</li>
                    <li>Use machine learning techniques to improve the quality of data or product offerings</li>
                    <li>Communicate recommendations to other teams and senior staff</li>
                    <li>Deploy data tools such as Python, R, SAS, or SQL in data analysis</li>
                    <li>Stay on top of innovations in the data science field</li>
                </ul>

        <h1>Data analyst vs data scientist: What’s the difference?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="p">
        <p>The work of data analysts and data scientists can seem similar—both find trends or patterns in data to reveal new ways for organizations to make better decisions about operations. But data scientists tend to have more responsibility and are generally considered more senior than data analysts.<br><br> 
            Data scientists are often expected to form their own questions about the data, while data analysts might support teams that already have set goals in mind. A data scientist might also spend more time developing models, using machine learning, or incorporating advanced programming to find and analyze data.<br><br>
            Many data scientists can begin their careers as data analysts or statisticians.</p>
