<h1>What is a Chief Executive Officer (CEO)?</h>
</div>
<div class="p">
<p>To answer the question, "What is a CEO?", it's important to first understand the acronym. CEO stands for "chief executive officer." A chief executive officer governs the strategic direction of an organization by making top-level managerial decisions. While they may seek opinions from other C-level officers, directors or managers within the organization, the success of the company generally depends on their strategic direction. Some CEOs may have the title of president, managing director or executive director. If the CEO is the leader of a publicly traded company, they answer to the board of directors and the stakeholders.</p>

    <h1>What does a CEO do?</h1>
</div>
<div class="p">
    <p>CEOs generally have several duties that include providing general leadership and strategic guidance for the company and its employees and helping to expand company operations and ensure long-term success. Here are some typical CEO duties:</p>
<div class="duties">
    <h3>Overseeing the organization's budget</h3>
    <p>The CEO works with the chief financial officer and executive management to create a budget that positions the company to achieve financial success. They may adjust department allocations to optimize growth as well as eliminate groups and services that aren't producing returns. They also manage and mitigate expenses and identify opportunities to expand or reduce the company budget to meet revenue goals.</p>
    <h3>Managing company resources</h3>
    <p>CEOs also help manage the company's strategic resources. Aside from money, organizations have resources in the form of industry connections, suppliers and vendors, labor and employees and sometimes investments. The CEO can help manage and distribute these assets as necessary for the company, providing guidance to other C-suite employees as to how to best use each resource for maximum benefit. For example, a CEO might enact new overtime policies to better maximize the company's labor force.</p>
    <h3>Setting the organization's strategic direction and revenue goals</h3>
    <p>The chief executive officer may drive change within the organization as part of the strategic direction and setting revenue goals. They are typically in charge of reporting on progress toward these goals to the board of directors and stakeholders. They might also enact specific requests from the board of directors or shareholders to increase profits and revenue, such as cutting labor costs or reducing material costs.</p>
    <h3>Leading a team of C-level officers and working with management</h3>
    <p>An important part of the CEO's job is providing leadership and guidance to other people in the organization, especially the executive team. The CEO sets the course for the business and works with top-level executives to pursue and achieve goals both the short and long-term life of the company. The CEO helps ensure that everyone shares the same vision and understands the strategic initiatives in place to help the business achieve that vision.</p>
    <h3>Functioning as the company's face and enhancing its image</h3>
    <p>CEOs also serve as the public face of a business. They might answer to the public for business practices, product quality and other concerns, or answer questions about the company's future and how it interacts with or serves the public. This can include interviews, press conferences and other public appearances. The CEO is also part of the public relations management for the company, helping to connect with the public and ensure they understand the company's purpose.</p>
    <h3>Watching industry changes, potential upheavals and assessing areas of opportunity</h3>
    <p>CEOs watch the changing landscape of the industry and decide when it's best to explore or invest in emerging market areas. If an organization has reached a saturation point of its current demographic, the CEO may launch an effort to explore other ideas through preliminary data collection and research. They also monitor company progress and market share to identify expansion, merger or acquisition opportunities to better position the business to dominate its industry.</p>
